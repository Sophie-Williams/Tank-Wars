<a name="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intro:</h2>

<p>This game is inspired by the evergreen classic Battle City.</p>

<ul>
<li>  There are two Tanks which can move around the Arena, collect
items and shoot at other destructable objects.</li>
<li>  There is a Command Base (referred to as Falcon) for each Tank.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="aim" class="anchor" href="#aim"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aim:</h2>

<ul>
<li>  The aim of the game is to score maximum points by the end of the
game. Points can be earned by collecting gold or by killing enemy
base or enemy tank.</li>
<li>  Game ends when

<ul>
<li>one of the tanks is killed or</li>
<li>the bases is shot down or</li>
<li>when the maximum number of moves have been made</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-to-get-started" class="anchor" href="#how-to-get-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Get Started:</h2>

<pre><code>We have done most of the hard work for you guys :P. All you guys
need to do is just write one function, the brain (or the Decision
Maker of the Tank as we see it :) ).

To enable you to get a feel for the game very early, we have a
pre-played game stored in this folder. Just double-click on the
tank_video_player.html file and click on play. You can see a
sample match being played there.

<h2>
<a name="to-get-started-with-coding" class="anchor" href="#to-get-started-with-coding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To get started with coding:</h2>

<pre><code>For those who can't wait to get started on their bots, here's the Quick-Start Guide.

The three important files from the player's perspective are the 
* DecisionMaker1.cpp
* Info.h (in the include folder)
* Info.cpp (in the src folder)

Decision Maker 

The participants (players) are required ONLY to modify
DecisionMaker1.cpp. All your code and supporting functions (if
any) will go into this file.

Info file

You can look at Info.h to understand better the information we
pass you. You are strongly discouraged to modify any other file
apart from DecisionMaker1.cpp and you shall be
disqualified if they are found to have done so.

The information there will help you go beyond the basic functions
we provide you and implement your very own special
strategies.

Then you can start coding by writing the appropriate
logic of your implementation in the get_player_move () function of
the DECISIONMAKER Class.

You can proceed in two ways : 

    * You can directly just look at the various possibilities and 
      code for them so that you take appropriate action

                            OR

    * You can try to build some mathematical model. We have given
      a basic Decision Making framework where you can set values
      for various strategies in a Weightage Table and Difficulty
      Table and calculate the best actions as per those weights.

    Best Mathematical models will be awarded special prizes.

<h2>
<a name="how-to-test-your-bots" class="anchor" href="#how-to-test-your-bots"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to test your Bots:</h2>

<pre><code> After you fill in DecisionMaker1.cpp with your code just use the
 terminal to go to the main directory which contains all these
 folders (especially the Makefile). You will find that we have
 already filled in default code for DecisionMaker2.cpp so that you
 can test your bot against it on your computer.

 Now, execute the following commands in order:

make play

 This will literally 'play' the game with your DecisionMaker1 code controlling Tank 1 and DecisionMaker2 code controlling Tank 2

make display

 This will open the match just played in Firefox. Just click on
 Play to see the match. Alternatively, open the game_display.html
 file manually in your favourite browser.

<a name="how-to-submit-your-bot" class="anchor" href="#how-to-submit-your-bot"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to submit your bot:</h2>

<pre><code> All you need to do is submit the DecisionMaker1.cpp to our online
 judge.  The initial few days are only for testing and feedback
 for participants.  At the end of this period you will be asked to
 submit your final bot. For further details and latest updates,
 visit our webpage online.

 Our online judge can be found at

 www.exebit.org or
 www.cse.iitm.ac.in/exebit/site

                        ALL THE BEST!!
