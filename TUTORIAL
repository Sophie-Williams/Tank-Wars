10-Minute Complete Step-by-Step Tutorial

* Prerequisites :
** The TankWars.zip file - Unzip it in any folder of your choice
** 10 minutes

   
* Introduction :
** As mentioned in the README, all you need to do to control your Tank is fill in the get_player_move () function in DecisionMaker1.cpp.
** To that end, this tutorial will take you through a series of increasingly complex definitions for that function.
** That will also familiarize you with the general information and structure of the code available to you to make your ultimate, indestructible Tank

* Aim of the Game:
** To end the game with maximum points
** The game ends when either your Falcon (military base) is killed or if your Tank dies or if the same happens to the opponent or if the Maximum number of moves are exceeded

* Description :
** The general structure of the Game is as follows :
*** The Arena or the environment in which the game runs and where the Bots clash contains all objects
*** So, in TankWars.cpp, where we want to run the Game Loop again and again, we simply call various methods of Arena object which will carry out various actions.
*** We need not be concerned with any of that
*** All that matters is that at each iteration, DecisionMaker1 is asked for a Move which will be used to make the Tank move on the Map
*** Of course, it is not just a matter of returning a Move, because you have to consider all the various elements on the Map, like Gold pieces, Machine Guns, Enemy Tank, Enemy Base (ie. Falcon), etc. in order to win the game
*** So, we'll consider all the mechanisms in place to give us the information we need and analyze them to return the best move we can think of

* Step 1 - A simple proof-of-concept Tank:
** This will make your Tank carry out the same action each time
** Just write :
   return Move (RIGHT);
** Then, 'make play' on the command-line, followed by 'make display'
** Not surprisingly, this makes your Tank move right each time
** However, that would have either led to it being shot by one of the Machine Guns out there or inevitably dashing into a wall and dying.
** Note : If your Tank dies, the opponent gains 400 points, so that is another incentive to stay alive

* Step 2 - A Tank that keeps moving between the two end walls
