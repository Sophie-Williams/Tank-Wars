{"name":"Tank-wars","tagline":"A game in which bots battle it out for glory and fortune!!","body":"TANK WARS v1.0\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIntro:\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis game is inspired by the evergreen classic Battle City.\r\n*   There are two Tanks which can move around the Arena, collect\r\n    items and shoot at other destructable objects.\r\n*   There is a Command Base (referred to as Falcon) for each Tank.\r\n\r\n\r\nAim:\r\n----\r\n\r\n*   The aim of the game is to score maximum points by the end of the\r\n    game. Points can be earned by collecting gold or by killing enemy\r\n    base or enemy tank.\r\n*   Game ends when\r\n    * one of the tanks is killed or\r\n    * the bases is shot down or\r\n    * when the maximum number of moves have been made\r\n\r\nHow to Get Started:\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n    We have done most of the hard work for you guys :P. All you guys\r\n    need to do is just write one function, the brain (or the Decision\r\n    Maker of the Tank as we see it :) ).\r\n\r\n    To enable you to get a feel for the game very early, we have a\r\n    pre-played game stored in this folder. Just double-click on the\r\n    tank_video_player.html file and click on play. You can see a\r\n    sample match being played there.\r\n\r\nTo get started with coding:\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n    For those who can't wait to get started on their bots, here's the Quick-Start Guide.\r\n\r\n    The three important files from the player's perspective are the \r\n    * DecisionMaker1.cpp\r\n    * Info.h (in the include folder)\r\n    * Info.cpp (in the src folder)\r\n\r\n    Decision Maker \r\n\r\n    The participants (players) are required ONLY to modify\r\n    DecisionMaker1.cpp. All your code and supporting functions (if\r\n    any) will go into this file.\r\n\r\n    Info file\r\n\r\n    You can look at Info.h to understand better the information we\r\n    pass you. You are strongly discouraged to modify any other file\r\n    apart from DecisionMaker1.cpp and you shall be\r\n    disqualified if they are found to have done so.\r\n    \r\n    The information there will help you go beyond the basic functions\r\n    we provide you and implement your very own special\r\n    strategies.\r\n\r\n    Then you can start coding by writing the appropriate\r\n    logic of your implementation in the get_player_move () function of\r\n    the DECISIONMAKER Class.\r\n\r\n    You can proceed in two ways : \r\n\r\n        * You can directly just look at the various possibilities and \r\n          code for them so that you take appropriate action\r\n\r\n                                OR\r\n\r\n        * You can try to build some mathematical model. We have given\r\n          a basic Decision Making framework where you can set values\r\n          for various strategies in a Weightage Table and Difficulty\r\n          Table and calculate the best actions as per those weights.\r\n\r\n        Best Mathematical models will be awarded special prizes.\r\n        \r\n\r\nHow to test your Bots:\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n     After you fill in DecisionMaker1.cpp with your code just use the\r\n     terminal to go to the main directory which contains all these\r\n     folders (especially the Makefile). You will find that we have\r\n     already filled in default code for DecisionMaker2.cpp so that you\r\n     can test your bot against it on your computer.\r\n\r\n     Now, execute the following commands in order:\r\n\r\n\tmake play\r\n\r\n     This will literally 'play' the game with your DecisionMaker1 code controlling Tank 1 and DecisionMaker2 code controlling Tank 2\r\n\r\n\tmake display\r\n\r\n     This will open the match just played in Firefox. Just click on\r\n     Play to see the match. Alternatively, open the game_display.html\r\n     file manually in your favourite browser.\r\n\r\nHow to submit your bot:\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n     All you need to do is submit the DecisionMaker1.cpp to our online\r\n     judge.  The initial few days are only for testing and feedback\r\n     for participants.  At the end of this period you will be asked to\r\n     submit your final bot. For further details and latest updates,\r\n     visit our webpage online.\r\n\r\n     Our online judge can be found at\r\n\r\n     www.exebit.org or\r\n     www.cse.iitm.ac.in/exebit/site\r\n\r\n                            ALL THE BEST!!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
