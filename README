TANK WARS v1.0
--------------

Intro:
-----
This game is inspired from the evergreen classic Battle City.
*   There are two Tanks which can move around the arena, collect
    items and shoot at other destructable objects.
*   There is a Command Base for each Tank.


Aim:
----
*The aim of the game is to score maximum points by the end of the
 game. Points can be earned by collecting gold or by killing
 enemy base of enemy tank.
*Game ends when one of the tanks or the bases is shot down or when
 the time (or maximum moves) ends.

How to Get Started:
------------------
    We have done most of the hard work for you guys :P. All you guys need to do
    is just write one function, the brain (or the Decision Maker
    of the Tank as we see it :).

    To enable you to get a feel for the game very early we have a 
    pre-played game stored in this folder. Just double click on the
    tank_video_player.html file and click on play. You can see a 
    sample match being played there.

    To get started with coding:
    The three important files from the player's perspective are the 
    * DecisionMaker1.cpp
    * Info.h (in the include folder)
    * Info.cpp (in the src folder)

    The participants(players) are required only to modify DecisionMaker.cpp
    while Info.h can be looked at to understand the various readymade
    information available for handy use by the participants.
    It is strongly discouraged to modify any other file apart from
    DecisionMaker1.cpp and participants shall be disqualified if they 
    are found to have done so.
    
    You can start by understanding the various information objects in
    the Info Class so that you can use them to make your implementation
    fast.
    Then you can start coding by writing the appropriate logic of your 
    implementation in the get_player_move function of the DECISIONMAKER 
    Class.You can proceed in two ways
        * You can directly just look at the various possibilities and 
        code for them so that you take appropriate action
                                OR
        * You can try to build some mathematical model.We have given a 
        basic idea where you can set value in a  weightage table and 
        dificulty table and choose your actions upon those calculations.

        Best Mathematical models  will be awarded special prizes.
        

How to test your bots:
---------------------

After you fill in DecisionMaker1.cpp with your code just go to the main
directory which contains all these folders (especially the Makefile)
using the terminal and execute the following commands in order

make play
make display

The match will open in your browser.
Just click on Play to see the match.

How to submit your bot:
-----------------------

All you need to do is submit the DecisionMaker.cpp to our online judge.
The initial 10 days are only for testing and feedback for participants.
At the end of this period you will be asked to submit your final bot.
Our online judge can be found at exibit.org or www.cse.iitm.ac.in/exebit/site

                            ALL THE BEST!!
